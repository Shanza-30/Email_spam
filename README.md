# Email_spam
This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using natural language processing techniques. It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline‚Äîfrom data cleaning and visualization to model evaluation.

üîç Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset by removing null values, punctuation, and stopwords. Emails were lowercased and tokenized to prepare for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visual tools such as bar charts, histograms, pie charts, and word clouds were used to analyze the distribution and key patterns in spam vs. non-spam emails.

Feature Extraction:
Applied CountVectorizer and TF-IDF to convert text into numerical format for model training.

Model Building:
Trained and tested various classifiers including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest using train_test_split.

Evaluation:
Assessed models with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to identify the most effective algorithm.
